# Demo for recursion

There is also a little comparison between Iteration and Recursion.

With recursion the function will call itself again until the exit condition is
reached. The iteration means the step will be repeated until the exit condtion 
is reached. The difference is here that the function wonÂ´t call itself again.
The iteration happens within a for-loop.
